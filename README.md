# fish config

This is my [fish](https://fishshell.com/) config. It is designed to work on
macOS and GNU/Linux, at the very least. It's unlikely that it'll be useful
to anyone else, as it's very much about the way I work, but I make it
available here just in case.

The key points with this config are:

- This repository is designed to be cloned in `~/.config` and is designed to
  be general to all machines I work on.
- Each machine can have a `~/.config/local-fish` which this configuration
  [will load up](conf.d/local-config.fish). Such configurations are
  maintained locally. For example, none of my work-specific configuration is
  in here, but the `~/.config/local-fish` on my work machines is held in a
  repository in work's GitLab server.
